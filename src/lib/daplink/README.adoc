[NOTE]
====
These are more or less unmodified (but selected) files from
https://github.com/ARMmbed/DAPLink[DAPLink].

If the files should be refreshed due to changes in DAPLink, some care has to be taken
not to revert changes unintentionally. +
Files with important changes are `swd_host.*`.

Extendening YAPicoprobes capabilites with new targets (aka DAPLink files) should be
straight forward.  Check the nRF52 files in the DAPLink source tree. +
Additionally auto-detect code in pico_prerun_board_config() has to be adopted
accordingly.
