## Optimizations

### SWD / PIO
Several PIO optimizations has been implemented.  Main idea of PIO control has
been taken from https://github.com/essele/pico_debug/blob/main/swd.pio[pico_debug].

To monitor the progress between the several versions,
https://sigrok.org/wiki/PulseView[PulseView] has been used. LA probe was
https://github.com/pico-coder/sigrok-pico[sigrok-pico].

#### First Version (03.01.2023 - e2b4a67)

#### (Currently) Final Version (06.01.2023 - 28fd8db)

#### Explanation / Conclusion
The plots above were taken at SWCLK=15MHz.  Absolute time of the four command sequences
shrunk from ~25us to 18us.  Not bad.

Nevertheless there are still gaps which may give more optimization opportunities.
Switching times between read / write and the gap between two commands are
candidates.  Note that moving code into RAM did not really help (and
optimization is still a non/slow-working mystery).
