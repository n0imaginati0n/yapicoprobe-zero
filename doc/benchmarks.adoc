## Benchmarks

### CMSIS / SWD

#### cp / OpenOCD / pyOCD

Benchmarking is done with an image with a size around 400KByte.  Command lines are as follows:

* **cp**: `time cp firmware.uf2 /media/picoprobe/`
* **OpenOCD 0.12.0-rc2** (CMSIS-DAP)v2: `time openocd -f interface/cmsis-dap.cfg -f target/rp2040.cfg -c "adapter speed 25000" -c "program {firmware.elf}  verify reset; shutdown;"`
* **OpenOCD 0.12.0-rc2** (CMSIS-DAP)v1: `time openocd -f interface/cmsis-dap.cfg -f target/rp2040.cfg -c "cmsis_dap_backend hid; adapter speed 25000" -c "program {firmware.elf}  verify reset; shutdown;"`
* **pyOCD 0.34.3**: `time pyocd flash -f 25000000 -t rp2040 firmware.elf`, pyOCD ignores silently "-O cmsis_dap.prefer_v1=true", except for the "list" option

Note that benchmarking takes place under Linux.  Surprisingly OpenOCD and pyOCD behave differently under Windows.
DAPv2 is always used, because DAPv1 does not run under Linux(?).

#### Comparison with picoprobe and automated_test.py of pyOCD

There is a good benchmark (actually the functional tests) in pyOCD: 
`automated_test.py`.  For configuration check https://github.com/pyocd/pyOCD/blob/main/docs/automated_tests.md

Comparing the original picoprobe firmware (running on the official Raspi Pico Debug Probe)
and YAPicoprobe shows the following picture:

(*) unexpected error only observed in conjuntion with the nRF52840 dongle.


Tests were performed with the following configuration:

```yaml
probes:
  <probe-unid>:
    frequency:       [12468]000000
    target_override: nrf52840
    test_binary:     l1_nrf52840-dk.bin
```

Findings are not completely clear:

* the original probe firmware is very slow, no clue about the actual reason.  Weird is that runtime with the
  original firmware is not frequency dependant

* there seems to be a frequency limit of the debug probe HW
  at around 6MHz due to its in-series resistors (runtime increase from 6 to 8MHz)

* the nRF52840 dongle has problems with >=6MHz as well.  Either a PCB or a nRF52840 part problem.
  Max frequency of 4MHz should be used
  
* good setups are
** YAPicoprobe + PCA10056 @ 6MHz
** YAPicoprobe + nRF52840 dongle @ 4MHz


#### probe-rs: picoprobe vs yapicoprobe

Using `probe-rs benchmark --address 0x20000000 --chip nrf52840_xxaa --speed 10000`
as a simple benchmark shows the following result for maximum speed:

picoprobe 1.1: ~107KByte/s

yapicoprobe 1.20: ~175KByte/s

probe-rs is at version 0.23.


## Network

This is a simple network performance measurement with 
`for MSS in 100 800 1450; do iperf -c 192.168.14.1 -e -i 1 -M $MSS -l 8192 -P 1; sleep 2; done`
over CPU frequency.  Network driver is NCM (new),
application is running on one core.

Network throughput is almost identical from 72..192MHz and makes a jump
by about 50% at 216MHz.
Maximum `iperf` throughput is 5MBit/s.

NOTE: Benchmarks took place with YaPicoprobe v1.18 and `Debian 6.4.4 x86_64 GNU/Linux`.
With the following kernel, the numbers were different: better iperf, but 
worse SystemView throughput.
