## TODOs

### Features
* Wireless with PicoW
** USBIP
*** https://usbip.sourceforge.net/
*** https://github.com/thevoidnn/esp8266-wifi-cmsis-dap
*** https://github.com/windowsair/wireless-esp8266-dap
** https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_5/Driver/html/group__wifi__interface__gr.html[CMSIS WiFi interface]
* semihosting?  But actually what can the probe do in this case?


### Bugs
** check the benchmark "miracle" with the NDEBUG version 
** if `configTICK_RATE_HZ` is around 100, SWD IF no longer works
* TODO
** voltage of SWD IF is VDD
** DAP_PACKET_SIZE: how to increase?
** description of the several COM ports
** MSD/MSC commands just like in DAPLink
* tests
** Reset line between probe and target have to be reviewed
** Win10 (tools) compatibility

### Internals

* parts of the code (at the moment just few) are in a somewhat transition to WiFi.
  These parts are surrounded often by `TARGET_BOARD_PICO_W`, so easy identifiable.
  Image for PicoW can be build by setting the board in CMakeLists.txt
