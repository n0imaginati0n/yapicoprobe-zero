All unfortunately without level shifters and without the possibility to use
YaPicoprobes sigrok features.  So there is some space left for other hardware
(ideas).

### SWDIR / SWDIO

Level shifter must be used to allow different voltage levels on probe and target.
There are different switching circuits out there, e.g.

* https://www.ti.com/product/TXS0108E[TXS0108E] (or TXS0102/4E) which
  allows 3.3V on probe side and up to 5V on target side for up to 8 signals
* https://www.ti.com/product/SN74LXC1T45[74LXC1T45] which allows the same voltage levels
  for a single signal (depending of type)

Because SWDIO is a bidirectional signal, the level shifter must
switch between input and output.  The TXS010xx does this automatically while the 74LXCxT45
requires an SWDIR signal to control direction.

Drawback of the automatic switching are much lower frequencies (\<=24MHz) which may pass
the component and the condition Vcca\<=Vccb.  So the TXS0108E is actually not
recommended for this purpose.

For a clean implementation SWDIR has been provided to allow support of the 74LXCxT45.  The following image
shows the timing of SWDIR, SWCLK and SWDIO.

### sigrok

For the sigrok input signals it's also good practice to use level shifter if the target
uses other voltage levels than the probe.



### Ideas

The firmware calls for a new hardware.  To get a really nice probe, some
level shifters , LEDs and power regulator for target supply would be required.

Following parts could be used:

* use 2x https://www.ti.com/product/SN74LXC1T45[74LXC1T45] for the SWD IF,
  largest package: 6 pin SOT-23
* 7803 for power supply of target
* https://www.ti.com/product/SN74LVC8T245[74LVC8T245] level shifter for sigrok input,
  24 pin SOIC / _SOP_ packages are visible for soldering
