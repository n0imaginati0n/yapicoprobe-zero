# Yet Another Picoprobe Clone for RP2040 Zero

## Overview

There is a chain of forks and clones which lead to this project. This time it was forked from 
https://github.com/rgrr/yapicoprobe[YAPicoprobe]. And I want to say big thanks to it's author.

I don't plan to develop the code further, but want to write down what was done to get this 
probe working. Basically I wanted something like a logic analyzer and analog tracker, 
plus DAPLink to get it possible to program different devices based on ARM MCU.

I switched off all the debug code - tty console, debug output. I switched off the 
functionality related to segger SystemView - may be it is more stable, and can cover 
many cases, but I like the Sigrok Pulseview and want to use it instead. 

One more reason was to use cheap small board called https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/RP2040-Zero[RP2040 Zero].
It is much smaller, than original PI, buit still has enough pins for this application. And It has USB-C 
on board.

Ah, yea, I removed a makefile from YAPicoprobe. This fork took configuration in the CMakeLists.txt file and 
uses CMake only for build.

## Features

* **FAST**, at least faster than most other picoprobes, see link:doc/benchmarks.adoc[benchmarks]
* standard debug tool connectivity
** CMSIS-DAPv2 WinUSB (driver-less vendor-specific bulk) - CMSIS compliant debug channel
** CMSIS-DAPv1 HID - CMSIS compliant debug channel as a fallback
* MSC - drag-n-drop support of UF2 firmware image Ã  la https://github.com/ARMmbed/DAPLink[DAPLink]
  for RP2040/RP2350 and nRF52832/833/840 targets
* CDC - virtual com port for bidirectional communication with target
** UART connection between target and probe is redirected
** RTT terminal channel is automatically redirected into this CDC (if there is no
   CMSIS-DAPv2/MSC connection)
* https://www.segger.com/products/development-tools/systemview/[SystemView] support over TCP/IP (NCM/ECM/RNDIS)
* CDC - virtual com port for (debug) logging of the probe
* optional CDC sigrok probe - data collection on eight digital and three analog channels
  (logic analyzer and oscilloscope) with auto-trigger capability.
  See link:doc/sigrok.adoc[here] for more information
* LED for state indication
* Other Benefits
** on Windows no more Zadig fiddling because the underlying protocols of CMSIS-DAPv1 and v2 are driver-less
** easy drag-n-drop (or copy) upload of a firmware image to the target via the probe
** no more reset push button (or disconnect/connect cycle)  to put the target into BOOTSEL mode
** auto detection of RP2040/RP2350/nRF52/Generic targets


### Probe / Target Wiring
Wires between Pico probe and target board are shown below.  At least three wires (plus supply) are required:
SWCLK, SWDIO and Gnd.  The Reset line is optional.  If target UART RX/TX are used, additional two wires are needed.
Sigrok inputs go extra.

More information about setup can be found in the
https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf[Pico Getting Started Guide].
See "Appendix A: Using Picoprobe".

For information about cabling between Pico Debug Probe and target refer to the corresponding
https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/debug-probe.html[documentation].

For details about probe pin assignments see the link:doc/hardware.adoc[hardware section].
Ochamodev wrote a nice https://github.com/ochamodev/raspberry_pico_setup_guide[setup guide],
containing the steps from installation until debugging in VSCode. 

### Possible schematics

I've made this tool in iron. I'm not ready to offer a PCB now, but teh schematics itself is there:

link:doc/extern/yapicoprobe-zero.pdf[Schematics]

I've used LM324 OPAMP to make analogue inputs protected and have a possibility to shift zero level 
for measuring 0-based signals. Additionally I've used two transistors to make TXD and RXD tolerate 
to 3.3 and 5 volts. All of it not really precise, but works and LM324 can be mounted on socket to 
change it in case of some burn.

NOTE: For best RP2040 support, OpenOCD bundled with PlatformIO is recommended. 
      See <<platformio>>


[[dap-optimization]]
#### Parameter Optimization

YAPicoprobe tries to identify the connecting tool and sets some internal parameters for best performance.
Those settings are:

.Parameter Optimization
[%autowidth]
[%header]
|===
|Tool | Parameter

|pyOCD / CMSIS-DAPv2
|DAP_PACKET_COUNT=1 +
DAP_PACKET_SIZE=128

|OpenOCD / CMSIS-DAPv2
|DAP_PACKET_COUNT=1 +
DAP_PACKET_SIZE=512

|probe-rs / CMSIS-DAPv2
|DAP_PACKET_COUNT=8 +
DAP_PACKET_SIZE=512

|unknown / CMSIS-DAPv2
|DAP_PACKET_COUNT=1 +
DAP_PACKET_SIZE=64

|CMSIS-DAPv1 HID
|DAP_PACKET_COUNT=1 +
DAP_PACKET_SIZE=64
|===

For the adventurous both parameters are also user settable, see <<runtime-configuration>>.


#### SWD Adapter Speed
The tools above allow specification of the adapter speed.  This is the clock frequency between probe and target device.
Unfortunately DAP converts internally the frequency into delays which are always even multiples of clock cycles.
That means that actual clock speeds are `125MHz / (2*n)`, `n>=3` -> 20833kHz, 12500kHz, 10417kHz, ...

Normally the requested frequency is rounded down according to the possible values from above.  But if the specified frequency 
is completely out of range, the allowed maximum target SWD frequency is used, e.g. for the RP2040 24MHz.

Actually usable frequency depends on cabling and the DAP speed.  If the DAP cannot access memory with speed determined by the host, it responds
with WAIT and the host needs to retry.

Effects of cabling should be clear: the longer the cables plus some more effects, the worse the signals.  Which effectively means
slowing down clock frequency is required to get the data transported.

[TIP]
====
SWCLK speed for MSC and RTT (below) is set according to the latest used tool setup.
E.g. `pyocd reset -f 5000000 -t rp2040` sets SWCLK to 5MHz.
====

[NOTE]
====
SWD clock frequency is also limited by the target controller.  For nRF52 targets default clock is set to 6MHz,
for unknown SWD targets 2MHz are used.
====


### MSC - Mass Storage Device Class
Via MSC the so called "drag-n-drop" supported is implemented.  Actually this also helps in copying a UF2 image directly into the target via command line.

MSC write access, i.e. flashing of the target, is device dependent and thus works only for a few selected
devices which are in my range of interest.  Those devices are the RP2040 (and its flash "win w25q16jv"), the RP2350 and the
Nordic nRF52 family (namely nRF52832/833/840). +
For the RP2040/RP2350 some special flash routines has been implemented.  For nRF52 flashing
regular DAPLink modules have been taken.  Which also implies, that extending the probes capabilities shouln't be
too hard.

[NOTE]
====
* RP2040/RP2350: flash erase takes place on a 64KByte base:  on the first write to a 64 KByte page, 
  the corresponding page is erased.  That means, that multiple UF2 images can be flashed into the 
  target as long as there is no overlapping within 64 KByte boundaries
* nRF52: whole chip is erased on first write operation of an UF2 image which means that
  only one UF2 image can be flashed
====

Because CMSIS-DAP access should be generic, flashing of other SWD compatible devices is tool dependant
(OpenOCD/pyOCD).


### RTT - Real Time Transfer
https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/technology/about-real-time-transfer/[RTT]
allows transfer from the target to the host in "realtime" via the SWD interface.

The RTT control block on the target is automatically detected.  Currently channels 0 and 1 are supported.

To get the RTT channels running, code on the target has to be either instrumented or adopted.

[NOTE]
====
* only the devices RAM is scanned for an RTT control block, for unknown devices
  RAM the range 0x20000000-0x2003ffff is assumed
* don't be too overwhelmed about Seggers numbers in
  the above mentioned document.  The data must still be
  transferred which is not taken into account in the diagram
  (of course the target processor has finished
  after writing the data)
* only one of CMSIS-DAP / MSC / RTT can access the
  target at the same time.  RTT is disconnected in 
  case CMSIS-DAP or MSC are claiming access
* the probe tries hard to find an active RTT control block.
  Worst case scenario are multiple inactive RTT control blocks
  in the targets memory (this might happen if the targets RAM
  is not cleared completely)
====


#### Terminal I/O

RTT channel 0 is used for bidirectional console communication.  This channel is directed into the UART CDC
of the target device.

Communication is birectional, but don't expect high transfer rates from host to target.


#### SystemView

RTT channel 1 is used for communication with Seggers https://www.segger.com/products/development-tools/systemview/[SystemView].
YAPicoprobe provides the data over TCP at port 19111 which is the default for SystemView communication.
Default IP address of the probe (if not configured otherwise) is 192.168.14.1.

[NOTE]
====
SystemView communication via TCP/IP had been chosen to spare you from another CDC port and also
because SystemView over COM port works on my Linux device just until v3.30 (Segger promises
a fix for > 3.50a, nevertheless TCP/IP is used...)
====


### LED Indications

As the original RP2040-Zero board has a WS2812 RGB LED on board. And this LED managemnt is quite 
sensitive to the timings, I don;t want to add more trouble to teh MCU as it was. And decide to use 
simple additional LED as it was in YAPicoprobe.

.LED Indications
[%autowidth]
[%header]
|===
| State | Indication

| no target found
| 5Hz blinking

| DAPv1 connected
| LED on, off for 100ms once per second

| DAPv2 connected
| LED on, off for 100ms twice per second

| MSC active
| LED on, off for 100ms thrice per second

| UART data from target
| slow flashing: 300ms on, 700ms off

| target found
| LED off, flashes once per second for 20ms

| RTT control block found
| LED off, flashes twice per second for 20ms

| RTT data received
| LED off, flashes thrice per second for 20ms

| sigrok running
| 10Hz flashing

| sigrok waiting for auto trigger
| 10Hz negative flashing (flicker)
|===


#### Pico Debug Probe

The Pico Debug Probe has four additional LEDs.  Assignment is as follows:

.Pico Debug Probe Additional LEDs
[%autowidth]
[%header]
|===
| LED | Color | Indication

| UART_TX
| yellow
| 5ms flash, if target sends data

| UART_RX
| green
| 20ms flash, if target gets data

| DAP_TARGET_RUNNING
| yellow
| set by host tool

| DAP_CONNECTED
| green
| set by host tool

|===

[NOTE]
====
* currently OpenOCD sets both DAP_* LEDs on CMSIS-DAP connection
* pyOCD currently does not set the DAP_* LEDs at all
====


## Configuration

[[runtime-configuration]]
### Runtime Configuration of Probe Parameters

Several parameters can be configured via the Debug CDC of the probe.  These parameters include
the network selection and CPU/SWCLK frequencies.

Because configuration of the probe is seen as once in a life time, the interface is kept very simple.

Following procedure applies:

* connect with a terminal program to the Debug CDC of the probe
* unlock configuration thru hitting <enter>, this works as long there is no `pwd`
* commands: `<cmd>`
+
[%autowidth]
|====
| `help`     | show available variables/cmds
| `lock`     | lock the configuration parameters
| `killall`  | kill all current configuration parameters
| `reset`    | restart the probe
| `show`     | show the current configuration (initially empty)
|====
* variables: `<variable>=<value>`
+
[%autowidth]
|====
| `f_cpu`   | set CPU frequency in MHz
| `f_swd`   | set SWD frequency in kHz
| `net`     | set the net of the probes IP address `192.168.<net>.1`, defaults to "14"
| `nick`    | set nickname of the probe.  Use this with care because it also changes
              the USB serial number (which might be intended)
| `pwd`     | set a password for locking the configuration.  Unlocking is done subsequently with `pwd:<your-pwd>`
| `ram_start` +
  `ram_end` | RAM start/end for generic target to override default 0x20000000..0x20040000.  This is mainly for
              RTT detection
| `rtt`     | enable/disable RTT access, default is RTT enabled (0: disable, 1:enable)
| `dap_psize` +
  `dap_pcnt`| set `DAP_PACKET_SIZE` and `DAP_PACKET_COUNT`, see <<dap-optimization>>.  If only one of those values
              is set, the other goes to a default (64/1)
|====
* special characters:
** CR/LF - end the line
** BS - backspace one character
* unknown commands / variables are ignored and lock configuration
* if configuration is locked, all commands are ignored (except `pwd:<your-pwd>`)


[NOTE]
====
* the interface is far from perfect
* after every configuration change, the probe must restart
====


### udev rules

----

### Network Configuration

SystemView connectivity over TCP/IP is on most systems not configuration free.

If everything is configured fine, the probe has the default address 192.168.14.1 and the host computer
gets 192.168.14.2.

#### Debian

On Debian the configuration is as follows:

* after connecting the probe with the host, `ip a` shows its network interface, e.g. `enxfe<your-probe>`.
  If the network interface already shows an IP address everything is fine and you are ready
* if not, then you can get the IP address with `sudo dhclient enxfe<your-probe>`
* to make this permanent add the following lines to `/etc/network/interfaces`:

[source]
----
allow-hotplug enxfe<your-probe>
iface enxfe<your-probe> inet dhcp
----

On my system this unfortunately leads to error messages (which are harmless) if the probe is not connected.

#### Win10

A certain version of Win10 is required for USB-NCM connectivity.  Exact version is unknown.

The driver needs to be installed manually.  Procedure is roughly as follows:

* in "Device Manager" search for `YaPicoprobe NCM` with an exclamation mark
* "Update Driver"
* "Browse my computer for drivers"
* "Let me pick..."
* "Network adapters"
* "Microsoft"
* "UsbNcm Host Device" - if this is not available, then the version of Win10 is not ready for USB-NCM
* confirm any dialog boxes
* if `ipconfig` on a command line shows `192.168.14.2` for an Ethernet adapter, the procedure has most likely
  succeeded and SystemView is ready for operation

#### Win11

It is said, that USB-NCM is working out of the box.  This has not been tested.


### PlatformIO [[platformio]]
https://platformio.org/[PlatformIO] configuration in `platformio.ini` is pretty straight forward:

.PlatformIO configuration
[source,yaml]
----
[env:pico]
framework = arduino
platform = https://github.com/maxgerhardt/platform-raspberrypi
board = rpipicow
board_build.core = earlephilhower
upload_protocol = cmsis-dap
debug_tool = cmsis-dap
monitor_speed = 115200
monitor_port  = /dev/ttyPicoTarget
----

The firmware image can alternativly copied directly (and faster) via MSC with custom upload:

.PlatformIO copy configuration
[source,yaml]
----
[env:pico_cp]
...
upload_protocol = custom
upload_command = cp .pio/build/pico_cp/firmware.uf2 /media/picoprobe
...
----

I'm sure there are smarter ways to specify the image path.

Optional: there is also a special PlatformIO handling in the probe: it ignores the defensive 1MHz clock setting which is used by
the above contained OpenOCD.  Standard clock is thus 15MHz.  If this is too fast, set the frequency with
`pyocd reset -f 1100000 -t rp2040` or similar.  If this is too slow, use `pyocd reset -f 50000000 -t rp2040`.


#### RTT
To use RTT for debug/console output the following has to be done:

* in `platformio.ini`:
----
[env:pico]
...
lib_deps =
    ...
    koendv/RTT Stream
----

* in main.cpp:
[source,C]
----
...
#include <RTTStream.h>
...
RTTStream rtt;
...
rtt.println("main module");
----

* in other modules:
[source,C]
----
...
#include <RTTStream.h>
...
extern RTTStream rtt;
...
rtt.println("sub module");
----



## Internals

### Building from Source [[how-to-build]]

Building from source is done with the help of a stub Makefile which eases integration into Eclipse (but can be
used from command line as well).  The Makefile creates via cmake a `build.ninja` which is responsible for
the actual build process.

To build the project, there must be somewhere a recent https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk[Pico SDK] and
the environment variable `PICO_SDK_PATH` must point to it.

NOTE: I'm most of the time on the master branch of TinyUSB which is part of the Pico SDK.  Originally
TinyUSB 0.18.0 is being used by Pico SDK 2.1.1. +
So if you experience unexpected behaviour, I recommend to update TinyUSB and retry. 

If you want to adopt YAPicoprobe options to your needs, check CMakeLists.txt and invoke cmake accordingly.

Requirements:

* arm-none-eabi-gcc
* cmake, ninja
* Pico SDK

.Clone yapicoprobe including submodules
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/n0imaginati0n/yapicoprobe-zero.git
cd yapicoprobe-zero
git submodule update --init --recursive
----

.General build sequence
[source,bash]
----
# it is nice idea to keep all teh generated files in sepoarate dir. it will not pollute all the project
# crewate build dir
mkdir _build

# switch to build dir
cd _build

# ask CMake to configure and generate buil scnarios for Ninja. I like Ninja, but one can use many 
# other generators, like GNU Makefiles or MS VS. read CMake help
cmake -G Ninja ..

# ask CMake to build a project for you
cmake --build .

# got to the initial dir
cd ..
----

.Build sequence for a specific board [pico|pico_w|pico_debug_probe|waveshare_rp2040_zero]

all the same as before, but either you will specify CMake variable in the commandline at
[source,bash]
----
cmake -G Ninja .. -DPICO_BOARD=pico_w -D<option>=<value> 
----
or modify teh CmakeLists.txt file

.Build firmware images for supported boards, images can be found in images/yapicoprobe*.uf2
[source,bash]
----
make create-images
----

If you want to know the several options use the one liner in the build directory:
`cmake -LH . | sed -n -e '/OPT_/{x;1!p;g;$!N;p;D;}' -e h`. +
Or use simply `make show-options` in the projects root.
